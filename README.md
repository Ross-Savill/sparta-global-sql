# sparta-global-sql-project
Week Two of my training course with Sparta Global involved a deep dive into beginner and intermediate SQL. 

At the basic level we tackled DDL (**Data Definition Language**) commands including *CREATE, ALTER*, *PROP* and *TRUNCATE* and DML (**Data Manipulation Language**) commands including *SELECT*, *INSERT*, *UPDATE* and *DELETE*.

After understanding these we moved on to to more intermediate functionality involving *INNER/LEFT/RIGHT* and *FULL OUTER* Joins and Subqueries which allowed us to more intricately command the tables we made and were given. 

Beyond the more basic level of securing specified data through SELECT/FROM/WHERE commands and expanding our data search through Join commands, we used *ORDER BY* and *HAVING* to present the data in a more understandable format as per the questions.

For questions 3.2 and 3.4 we were required to export the data to Excel to present the data in graph format - these graphs have been included in the Word doc and PDF as screenshots and the excel files generated have also been included in the repo.
