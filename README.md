# sparta-global-sql-project
Week Two of my training course with Sparta Global involved diving into beginner and intermediate SQL and using the knowledge gained to manipulate data provided by the Northwind database into formats specified in the questions provided. 

## Functionality Studied

At the basic level we tackled DDL (**Data Definition Language**) commands including *CREATE, ALTER*, *PROP* and *TRUNCATE* and DML (**Data Manipulation Language**) commands including *SELECT*, *INSERT*, *UPDATE* and *DELETE*.

After understanding these we moved on to to more intermediate functionality involving *INNER/LEFT/RIGHT* and *FULL OUTER* Joins and Subqueries which allowed us to more intricately command the tables we made and were given. 

Beyond the more basic level of securing specified data through SELECT/FROM/WHERE commands and expanding our data search through Join commands, we used *GROUP BY*, *ORDER BY* and *HAVING* to present the data in a more understandable format as per the questions.

## Brief Questions Overview

Questions 1.1 - 1.8 required primarily DML language commands to secure the tabled data required. Question 1.6 was noticably more difficult, requiring 4-5 Table Joins to bring together various columns. Subqueries were also used to breakdown and sum data which was then subsequently managed through *GROUP BY*, *ORDER BY* and *HAVING* commands.

Questions 2.1 and 2.2 were fairly straightforward questions involving the combination of DDL and DML commands to produce the required output.

For questions 3.2 and 3.4 we were required to export the data to Excel to present the data in graph format - these graphs have been included in the Word doc and PDF as screenshots and the excel files generated have also been included in the repo.
